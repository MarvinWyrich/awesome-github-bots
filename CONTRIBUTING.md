## Adding an awesome bot

If you have something awesome to contribute, this is how you do it.

### Guidelines
You'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)!

1. Access the [awesome-github-bots GitHub page](https://github.com/mairieli/awesome-github-bots).
2. Click on the [readme.md](README.md) file.
3. Now click on the edit icon. 
4. You can start editing the text of the file in the in-browser editor:

   Add the link: `* [project-name](http://example.com/) - A short description ends with a period.`
   
   * Keep descriptions concise.
   * Add a section if needed. Don't forget to add the section description and the section title to the table of contents.
5. Say why you're proposing the changes, and then click on "Propose file change".
6. Submit the pull request! Please, add one link (bot) per Pull Request. 

**Please...**
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Remove any trailing whitespace.
- Send a Pull Request with the reason why the GitHub bot is awesome.

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, we will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-github-bots list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
